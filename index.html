        <p>I'm Srishti Mahitha! My favourite hobby is to read books, in the fantasy and myth genre. I like fantasy and myth books as they let your imagination run wild and not based on real life. I also like reading adventure books of any genre. Other than books, I like writing too. I LOVE writing books so much and you guessed it, in the fantasy genre.like I said, I love fantasy as it lets your imagination go free. and there are no specific rules to follow for writing in this genre. And the next hobby is drawing and art! I love doing digital art as you get the exact color you want and you can customize the brushes too! and your drawing never gets lost while on a paper you may misplace it. While on the other hand, I like traditional art or the art you draw with your hand as you don't need any gadgets to draw. and your hand is more free to roam around. </p>
